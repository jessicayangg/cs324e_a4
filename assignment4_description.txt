Project Summary
This project aimed to create a captivating 2D animation scene in Processing that portrays a stylized solar system. The scene includes background stars, rotating planets with moons and rings, a rotating sun and moon, as well as special appearances by shooting and flashing stars. Each object in the scene exhibits unique animations, making the sketch a lively depiction of a whimsical cosmic landscape.

Class Descriptions
Star.pde: This class handles the background stars, which add a cosmic atmosphere to the scene.
Planet.pde: Krishna developed this class to create rotating planets with moons and rings, rendering a central piece of the animation.
Moons.pde: Aayush worked on this class to display moons orbiting the planets, adding depth to the solar system.
Moon.pde: This class, crafted by Aayush, provides a rotating moon animation, contributing to the solar system's dynamic nature.
Sun.pde: Aayush also developed this class to animate a rotating sun, infusing life into the scene with a central light source.
StarS.pde: Jessica designed this class to bring shooting stars into the scene, adding fleeting moments of excitement.
StarF.pde: This class, also by Jessica, creates flashing stars, providing twinkling effects that enrich the cosmic ambiance.
Ring.pde: Integrated within the Planet class by Krishna, this class displays rings around the planets, enhancing their visual appeal.
Challenges Encountered
One of the unexpected challenges was ensuring a hierarchical grouping within the classes to fulfill the assignment requirements of having at least two levels of hierarchical grouping. Achieving a realistic rotation effect for the planets and their moons required a nuanced understanding of Processing's rotation and translation functions. Additionally, getting the shooting stars and flashing stars to render and animate correctly amid the other ongoing animations posed a certain level of complexity.

Contribution
Aayush: Developed the Moon.pde and Sun.pde classes for the rotating moon and sun animations.
Jessica: Crafted the StarS.pde and StarF.pde classes for the shooting star and flashing star animations.
Krishna: Worked on the background stars in Star.pde and the rotating planets with moons in Planet.pde and Moons.pde.
This project was a collaborative effort where each member was responsible for their individual parts, ensuring active participation and mastery of the assignment by all group members.
